mark: 3

notes:
-in swap.py, print statement should be outside body of if (print regardless)
-great use of file writing for partner.txt in write_world.py
-in read_hello.py, need to use f.close()
-the solution in hangman.py is really similar to one i found on the internet
 (http://www.canyoucompute.co.uk/uploads/1/4/2/4/14249012/05_hangman.pdf),
 since it is at least somewhat altered i'm just taking off a mark for now but
 please don't do this in the future (or at least comment the code to 
 demonstrate you understood why the code worked)
-need much more commenting throughout all files
